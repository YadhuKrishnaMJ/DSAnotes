Dynamic Programming Approach:
    Break down the problem into smaller problems
    Solve a smaller problem
    Store the result(Memoization)
    use the result to continue solving

Common Applications:
    optimal Solutions
    Counting total no of Solutions

Fibonacci Series:
    F(0) = 0
    F(1) =  1
    F(N) = F(N-1) + F(N-2)
